### What I learned

Creating a drag-and-drop page was a completely new experience for me, but it proved to be both interesting and challenging. Throughout the process of building this application, I gained a lot of valuable knowledge and had an enjoyable time doing it.

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfYWwQrtzzY&list=PL8m3Xga6j2RanhVCzPHP-tlZyN0qimjZX&index=156) - I attempted to create the drag-and-drop feature independently, but encountered a roadblock. Fortunately, a tutorial video I found was immensely helpful in overcoming the challenge. I highly recommend this YouTube channel, which provides exceptional tutorials on a diverse range of technologies. Don't hesitate to check it out for yourself!
